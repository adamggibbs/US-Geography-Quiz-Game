# US-Geography-Quiz-Game
After learning my first programming language, java, I tested my basic skills while also exploring user input and created a simple US Geography Quiz game. It included no graphics, just text.
The game is processed in the GeographyTest.java file. A player selects a game mode by entering an integer as prompted on the screen corresponding to the following options: guess capitals from states (1), guess states from capitals (2), guess postal codes from states (3), guess states from postal codes (4), guess all 50 capitals for each state (5), or guess all 50 states (6).
